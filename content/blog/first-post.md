    # My first blog post
    Welcome to my first blog post using \[content v2 module\](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
    Hey there! 👋🏾
    This is my first blog post learning nuxt content.
    I'm currently building it using the following:
    - Nuxt.js
    - Nuxt Content module
    - TailwindCSS
      - TailwindCSS typography

    ## Nuxt.js
    \[Nuxt\](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a powerful Vue framework that offers excellent development features such as server-side rendering.

    ```bash
    npx nuxi init nuxt-app
    cd nuxt-app
    yarn install
    yarn dev -o
    ```
